# ESP32 Performance Guide - PixelRoot32

## 🔥 Hot Path Rules

**Hot paths** = `update()`, `draw()`, collision detection loops, audio callbacks.

**Prohibited in hot paths:**

| Feature | Why | Alternative |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| `std::optional` | Extra branching/code size | Raw pointers or sentinel values |
| Virtual calls | Vtable indirection | Templates or function pointers |
| `new` / `malloc` | Heap fragmentation | Pre-allocated pools |
| `std::vector::push_back` | Potential reallocation | Fixed-size arrays with flags |
| Logging / `log()` | String formatting overhead | Debug-only counters or periodic logging |
| `std::rand()` | Slow, uses division | `math::randomScalar()` (Xorshift) |

## ⚡ Performance (ESP32 Focus)

### Inlining

- Define trivial accessors (e.g., `getHitBox`, `getX`) in the header (`.h`) to allow compiler inlining.
- Keep heavy implementation logic in `.cpp`.

### Fast Randomness

`std::rand()` is slow and uses division. Use `math::randomScalar()` or `math::randomRange()` (which use optimized Xorshift algorithms compatible with `Fixed16`) for visual effects.

### Collision Detection

- Use simple AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) checks first. Use Collision Layers (`GameLayers.h`) to avoid checking unnecessary pairs.
- For very fast projectiles (bullets, lasers), prefer lightweight sweep tests:
  - Represent the projectile as a small `physics::Circle` and call `physics::sweepCircleVsRect(startCircle, endCircle, targetRect, tHit)` against potential targets.
  - Use sweep tests only for the few entities that need them; keep everything else on basic AABB to avoid unnecessary CPU cost.

### Single-Core Resource Contention (ESP32-C3)

Single-core architectures (like the ESP32-C3) run the game logic, display transfers, and audio synthesis on a single core.

- **Priority Inversion**: Heavy display transfers (like full-screen U8G2 refreshes) can block the audio task, causing buffer underruns and audio glitches. The engine dynamically detects single-core platforms and elevates the audio task priority (e.g., to `18`) to protect audio streams.
- **Context Thrashing**: An audio priority that is *too* high (e.g., `24`) will preempt the display transfer constantly to synthesize audio, fragmenting the hardware SPI transaction and ballooning draw times (up to 4x). The engine mitigates this by balancing priority, reducing audio buffer block sizes to `128` samples, and using `taskYIELD()` for cooperative multitasking.
- **Float Operations**: Soft-float emulation on the ESP32-C3 is extremely slow. The engine provides integer Q15 implementations for performance-critical inner loops (like `tickEnvelopeQ15` and audio mixer LUTs). Avoid introducing new float-based calculations inside per-sample audio loops or per-pixel drawing loops.

## 💾 Memory & Resources

**📖 For comprehensive C++17 memory management guide, see [Memory Management Guide](../../architecture/memory-system.md)**

### Smart Pointers (C++17)

Use `std::unique_ptr` for **init-time ownership** (Scenes, Actors, UI elements) to automate memory management and document ownership.

- Use `std::make_unique<T>(...)` to create objects during initialization only.
- Pass raw pointers (via `.get()`) to functions that do *not* take ownership (like `addEntity`).
- Use `std::move` only when transferring ownership explicitly.
- ⚠️ **Do not use in hot paths**: `unique_ptr` is for init-time, not runtime game loop.

### Object Pooling

Pre-allocate all game objects (obstacles, particles, enemies) during `init()`.

- Pools are for **runtime** zero-allocation recycling; `unique_ptr` is for **init-time** ownership semantics.
- Pattern: Use fixed-size arrays (e.g., `Particle particles[50]`) and flags (`isActive`) instead of `std::vector` with `push_back`/`erase`.
- Trade-off: Eliminates runtime allocations and fragmentation at the cost of a slightly higher fixed RAM footprint; dimension pools to realistic worst-case usage.

### Zero Runtime Allocation

Never use `new` or `malloc` inside the game loop (`update` or `draw`).

### String Handling

Avoid `std::string` copies. Use `std::string_view` for passing strings. For formatting, use `snprintf` with stack-allocated `char` buffers.

### Scene Arenas (`PIXELROOT32_ENABLE_SCENE_ARENA`)

Use a single pre-allocated buffer per scene for temporary entities or scratch data when you need strict zero-allocation guarantees.

- Trade-off: Very cache-friendly and fragmentation-proof, but the buffer cannot grow at runtime; oversizing wastes RAM, undersizing returns `nullptr` and requires graceful fallback logic.

## 🏗️ Build Profiles

PixelRoot32 supports two build profiles for different use cases:

### Embedded Profile (Default)

For ESP32 and resource-constrained hardware:

- **Zero allocation** at runtime
- **No exceptions**, `-fno-exceptions` flag
- **Deterministic** behavior prioritized
- **Modular compilation** to reduce binary size
- **All Hot Path Rules** enforced

### Native Profile (Optional)

For PC simulation and development:

- **Relaxed constraints** for faster iteration
- **Exceptions permitted** if needed for tooling
- **Debug-friendly** features enabled
- **All subsystems** can be compiled in

Use `PLATFORM_NATIVE` flag to switch profiles.

## 📊 Recommended Build Profiles

Choose a profile based on your game type to optimize memory usage:

| Game Type | Profile | Enabled | Disabled |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| Arcade shooters/platformers | `arcade` | Audio, Physics, Particles | UI System |
| Puzzle/casual games | `puzzle` | Audio, UI System | Physics, Particles |
| Retro/minimal | `retro` | None | All |
| Educational/tools | `puzzle` or custom | Audio, UI System | Physics, Particles |

**Example platformio.ini configuration:**

```ini
[env:esp32_arcade]
extends = base_esp32, profile_arcade
build_flags =
    ${base_esp32.build_flags}
    ${profile_arcade.build_flags}

[env:esp32_puzzle]
extends = base_esp32, profile_puzzle
build_flags =
    ${base_esp32.build_flags}
    ${profile_puzzle.build_flags}

[env:native_retro]
build_flags =
    -DPLATFORM_NATIVE=1
    -DPIXELROOT32_ENABLE_AUDIO=0
    -DPIXELROOT32_ENABLE_PHYSICS=0
    -DPIXELROOT32_ENABLE_PARTICLES=0
    -DPIXELROOT32_ENABLE_UI_SYSTEM=0
```

## 📐 Resolution Scaling

PixelRoot32 separates **logical** resolution (what your game draws at) from **physical** resolution (the actual display), so you can target low pixel counts for performance while filling modern panels.

### When to Use

- Ship gameplay at 128×128 or 160×144 but drive a 240×240 TFT
- Keep UI and physics in logical space; only the final blit scales up

### Configure DisplayConfig

Set `logicalWidth` / `logicalHeight` for the render buffer and `physicalWidth` / `physicalHeight` for the panel. The renderer and input pipeline map between the two.

See [DisplayConfig / Engine](../../api/core.md#engine) and the architecture deep dive [Resolution Scaling](../../architecture/resolution-scaling.md) for implementation details, ESP32 considerations, and coordinate mapping.
